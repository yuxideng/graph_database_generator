September&nbsp;13, 2016, the Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) of Starbucks Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Starbucks&#148;) amended and restated the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated Bylaws (the &#147;Bylaws&#148;) to
implement proxy access, effective immediately. Following a majority shareholder vote on a proxy access proposal at the Company&#146;s 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company contacted shareholders collectively holding over 30% of the
Company&#146;s stock to discuss potential proxy access bylaw provisions. Through this engagement, the Company gained valuable feedback from its shareholders regarding specific terms that they view as appropriate for proxy access, allowing the Board
to implement terms which it believes will provide meaningful proxy access for shareholders while limiting the potential for abuse and advancing the long-term interests of Starbucks and its shareholders. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bylaws include a new Article&nbsp;IA that permits a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least three percent of the

provided that the shareholders and nominees satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bylaws also contain conforming,
clarifying, and updating changes to Sections 1.3, 1.10, and 1.11 related to the advance notice requirements for nominations and business proposed by shareholders at annual and special meetings of shareholders, as well as non-substantive changes to
Section&nbsp;1.6. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Bylaws, which is attached
