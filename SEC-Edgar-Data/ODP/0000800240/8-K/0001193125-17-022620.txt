across Lenovo&#146;s entire product portfolio, including an industry recognized supply chain organization. His long-standing relationships with some of Office Depot&#146;s largest suppliers will enable him to quickly transition into the role.
Additionally, we are impressed with Gerry&#146;s demonstrated ability to lead large, complex organizations.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;I am delighted to accept the

company&#146;s momentum and identifying additional opportunities to provide customers with an exceptional experience, drive innovation and growth in products and services, while delivering value to the company&#146;s shareholders.&#148; </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;Roland has been an outstanding CEO and, on behalf of the entire Board, I&#146;d like to express our sincere appreciation for his leadership,&#148;
continued Bryant. &#147;He has consistently delivered positive results, led the successful integration of Office Depot and OfficeMax to achieve synergies and efficiencies significantly exceeding original expectations, and he created and implemented
a new three-year strategic plan. As a result of his contributions, the company is well positioned for continued future success.&#148; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">&#147;As I
communicated last fall, stepping away from Office Depot has not been an easy decision,&#148; said Roland Smith. &#147;I&#146;m extremely proud of what our management team and associates have accomplished. During the past three years, we have
delivered a significant improvement in profitability, made substantial progress on all the components of our strategic plan and now </P>
