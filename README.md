the wrongful acts of directors or officers in this company. To estimate the risk of insuring a company more accurately, we want to 
identify risky directors and their current companies based on the assumption that companies with riskier directors have bigger chances
of suffering from a loss.To achieve this goal, we want represent the relationships between D&O in specified companies with a graph 
database, where vertices are entities and edges are relationships.
