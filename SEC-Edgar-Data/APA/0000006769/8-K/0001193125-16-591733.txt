designated by the Committee for participation in the Plan with equity-based incentives to: (i)&nbsp;encourage such individuals to continue in the long-term service of the Company and its Affiliates, (ii)&nbsp;create in such individuals a more direct
interest in the future success of the operations of the Company, (iii)&nbsp;attract outstanding individuals, and (iv)&nbsp;retain and motivate such individuals. The Plan is intended to provide eligible individuals with the opportunity to acquire an
equity interest in the Company, thereby relating incentive compensation to increases in stockholder value and more closely aligning the compensation of such individuals with the interests of the Company&#146;s stockholders. </P>

hereunder are conditioned on and shall be of no force or effect until the Plan is approved by the stockholders of the Company. The Committee (or its delegate in accordance with Section&nbsp;3.4(b) hereof) may grant Awards, the entitlement to which
shall be expressly subject to the condition that the Plan shall have been approved by the stockholders of the Company. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center">Section&nbsp;2 </P>

indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment subject to Internal Revenue Code Section&nbsp;409A under this Plan. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U><I>Six-Month Delay for

no such payment shall be made or commence during the period beginning on the Separation Date and ending on the date that is six months following the Separation Date or, if earlier, on the date of the Participant&#146;s death. The amount of any
payment that would otherwise be paid to the Participant during this period shall instead be paid to the Participant on the first day of the first calendar month following the end of the period. </P>
