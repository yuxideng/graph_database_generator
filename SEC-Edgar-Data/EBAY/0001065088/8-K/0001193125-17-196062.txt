promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate of 2.150%&nbsp;per annum from June&nbsp;6, 2017 until maturity. The Company will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on June&nbsp;5 and December&nbsp;5 of each year (each an
&#147;<B><I>Interest Payment Date</I></B>&#148;), commencing December&nbsp;5, 2017. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided
for, from June&nbsp;6, 2017; <I>provided</I> that if there is no existing default in the payment of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest will
accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date. The Company will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal at the per annum rate equal to the interest rate on this Note to
the extent lawful; and it will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest at the same per annum rate to the extent lawful. Interest on this Note will be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date (as defined in Section&nbsp;18 below), maturity date or other
date on which interest on this Note is due will be the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be. If an Interest Payment
Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date on which any payment on this Note is due falls on a day that is not a business day, then payment of principal and interest, as the case may be, due on such Interest
Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be, need not be made on such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case
may be, but may be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the
case may be. As used in this Section&nbsp;1 and Section&nbsp;2 below, the term &#147;business day&#148; means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law,
regulation or executive order to close (a &#147;New York business day&#148;); provided that such term shall mean, with respect to any place of payment of principal of or interest on the Notes, any day (a)&nbsp;which is not a Saturday, Sunday or
other day on which banking institutions in such place of payment are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close and (b)&nbsp;which is also a New York business day. </P>

Notes at the close of business on May&nbsp;21 or November&nbsp;20 (each a &#147;<B><I>Record Date</I></B>&#148;), as the case may be, whether or not a business day, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in

an &#147;<B><I>Interest Payment Date</I></B>&#148;), commencing January&nbsp;30, 2018. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided
for, from June&nbsp;6, 2017; <I>provided</I> that if there is no existing default in the payment of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest will

date on which interest on this Note is due will be the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be. If an Interest Payment
Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date on which any payment on this Note is due falls on a day that is not a business day, then payment of principal and interest, as the case may be, due on such Interest
Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be, need not be made on such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case

promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate of 3.600%&nbsp;per annum from June&nbsp;6, 2017 until maturity. The Company will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on June&nbsp;5 and December&nbsp;5 of each year (each an
&#147;<B><I>Interest Payment Date</I></B>&#148;), commencing December&nbsp;5, 2017. Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided
for, from June&nbsp;6, 2017; <I>provided</I> that if there is no existing default in the payment of interest, and if this Note is authenticated between a Record Date (as defined below) and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest will
accrue from such next succeeding Interest Payment Date. The Company will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue principal at the per annum rate equal to the interest rate on this Note to
the extent lawful; and it will pay interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest at the same per annum rate to the extent lawful. Interest on this Note will be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The amount of interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date (as defined in Section&nbsp;18 below), maturity date or other
date on which interest on this Note is due will be the amount of interest accrued to, but excluding, such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be. If an Interest Payment
Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date on which any payment on this Note is due falls on a day that is not a business day, then payment of principal and interest, as the case may be, due on such Interest
Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case may be, need not be made on such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the case
may be, but may be made on the next succeeding business day, and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date, redemption date, Change of Control Payment Date, maturity date or other date, as the
case may be. As used in this Section&nbsp;1 and Section&nbsp;2 below, the term &#147;business day&#148; means any day except a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in The City of New York are authorized or obligated by law,
regulation or executive order to close (a &#147;New York business day&#148;); provided that such term shall mean, with respect to any place of payment of principal of or interest on the Notes, any day (a)&nbsp;which is not a Saturday, Sunday or
other day on which banking institutions in such place of payment are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close and (b)&nbsp;which is also a New York business day. </P>

Notes at the close of business on May&nbsp;21 or November&nbsp;20 (each a &#147;<B><I>Record Date</I></B>&#148;), as the case may be, whether or not a business day, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in
