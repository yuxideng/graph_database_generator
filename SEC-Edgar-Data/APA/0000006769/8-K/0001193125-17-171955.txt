Access Notice submitted to the corporation. If the Permitted Number is not reached after each Eligible Stockholder has selected one Stockholder Nominee, this selection process will continue as many times as necessary, following the same order each

record who own or have owned, or are acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners who own and have owned (in each case as defined above), in each case continuously for at least three (3)&nbsp;years as of both the date that the Proxy Access
Notice is received by the corporation pursuant to this Section&nbsp;14, and as of the record date for determining stockholders eligible to vote at the annual meeting, an aggregate net long position (as defined in Section&nbsp;3 of this Article IV)
of at least three percent (3%)&nbsp;of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock (the &#147;Proxy Access Request Required Shares&#148;), and who continue to own the Proxy Access Request Required Shares at all times between the date such Proxy
Access Notice is received by the corporation and the date of the applicable annual meeting, provided that the aggregate number of stockholders, and, if and to the extent that a stockholder is acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners, of
such beneficial owners, whose stock ownership is counted for the purpose of satisfying the foregoing ownership requirement shall not exceed twenty (20). Two or more collective investment funds that are (I)&nbsp;under common management and investment
control; (II) under common management and sponsored primarily by the same employer; or (III) a &#147;group of investment companies&#148; as such term is defined in Section&nbsp;12(d)(1)(G)(ii) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (a
&#147;Qualifying Fund&#148;) shall be treated as one stockholder for the purpose of determining the aggregate number of stockholders in this paragraph (E), provided that each fund included within a Qualifying Fund otherwise meets the requirements
set forth in this Section&nbsp;14. No shares may be attributed to more than one group constituting an Eligible Stockholder under this Section&nbsp;14 (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no stockholder may be a member of more than one group
constituting an Eligible Stockholder). A record holder acting on behalf of one or more beneficial owners will not be counted separately as a stockholder with respect to the shares owned by beneficial owners on whose behalf such record holder has
been directed in writing to act, but each such beneficial owner will be counted separately, subject to the other provisions of this paragraph (E), for purposes of determining the number of stockholders whose holdings may be considered as part of an
Eligible Stockholder&#146;s holdings. For the avoidance of doubt, Proxy Access Request Required Shares will qualify as such if and only if the beneficial owner of such shares as of the date of the Proxy Access Notice has itself individually
beneficially owned such shares continuously for the three-year (3-year) period ending on that date and through the other applicable dates referred to above (in addition to the other applicable requirements being met). Any Eligible Stockholder
(including each Constituent Holder or fund comprising a Qualifying Fund and/or beneficial owner whose stock ownership is counted for the purposes of qualifying as an Eligible Stockholder) whose Stockholder Nominee is elected as a director at the
annual meeting of stockholders will not be eligible to nominate or participate in the nomination of a Stockholder Nominee for the following two (2)&nbsp;annual meetings of stockholders other than the nomination of such previously elected Stockholder
Nominee. </P>
