&#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;) completed a public offering pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the &#147;<U>Underwriting Agreement</U>&#148;) with Morgan Stanley&nbsp;&amp; Co. International plc and MUFG Securities EMEA plc (the
&#147;<U>Underwriters</U>&#148;), under which Starbucks agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters &yen;85,000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 0.372% Senior Notes due 2024 (the &#147;<U>Notes</U>&#148;). </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes are being issued under the Indenture, dated as of September&nbsp;15, 2016 (the &#147;<U>Base Indenture</U>&#148;), by and between the Company and
U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the &#147;<U>Trustee</U>&#148;), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March&nbsp;17, 2017 (the &#147;<U>Supplemental Indenture</U>&#148; and, together with the Base Indenture,
the &#147;<U>Indenture</U>&#148;), by and between the Company and the Trustee, as trustee, transfer agent and registrar, and Elavon Financial Services, DAC, UK Branch, as paying agent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Interest on the Notes will accrue from March&nbsp;17, 2017. Starbucks will pay interest on the Notes on each March&nbsp;15 and September&nbsp;15, beginning on
September&nbsp;15, 2017. The Notes will mature on March&nbsp;15, 2024. At any time on and after December&nbsp;15, 2023 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), Starbucks may redeem the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of such series, plus accrued and unpaid interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event of the Notes
(which involves the occurrence of both a change of control and a below investment grade rating of the Notes by Moody&#146;s and S&amp;P), Starbucks will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal
amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Notes will be the Company&#146;s senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right
of payment with all of the Company&#146;s other senior unsecured indebtedness, whether currently existing or incurred in the future. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or other liabilities, including
trade payables, of any of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries. The Notes are subject to customary covenants and events of default, as set forth in the Indenture. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The foregoing disclosure is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Base Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture. The Base Indenture was filed as
Exhibit 4.1 to the Company&#146;s Registration Statement on Form S-3 (SEC Registration No.&nbsp;333-213645) (the &#147;<U>Registration Statement</U>&#148;) and is incorporated herein by reference. The Supplemental Indenture is attached hereto as
Exhibit&nbsp;4.2 and incorporated herein by reference. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, in connection with the public offering of the Notes, Starbucks is filing the
Underwriting Agreement and certain other items listed below as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K for the purpose of incorporating such items into the Registration Statement. Such items filed as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K
