set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;8, in no event shall an
Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such
Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters&#146; obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section&nbsp;8 are several in proportion to the respective principal amount
